# PycURL Builds for Windows Platform

To facilitate testing __curldl__ on Windows, win32 builds of PycURL
are required.

Since [PycURL](https://pycurl.io/) has no official win32 builds
at the time of writing this document, unofficial binaries by
Christoph Gohlke are used instead, as downloaded from his
[website](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pycurl).

PycURL is dual licensed under the LGPL and an MIT/X derivative
license, so keeping these builds in the repo is fine.
